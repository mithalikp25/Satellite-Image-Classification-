🛰️ Satellite Image Classification using Deep Learning

Project Overview

This project focuses on satellite image classification using deep learning. The goal is to build a model that can automatically identify different types of land-use patterns from satellite imagery such as forests, residential areas, agricultural fields, roads, water bodies and more.

The project uses the EuroSAT RGB dataset, which contains over 27,000 labeled satellite images across 10 distinct classes. Using this dataset, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or a Transfer Learning architecture (like ResNet50) is trained to classify images with high accuracy.

Key tasks in this project include:

- Loading and preprocessing the EuroSAT satellite images
- Creating training, validation, and test splits
- Building and training a deep learning model
- Evaluating performance using accuracy and confusion matrices
- Saving the trained model for inference

This project serves as a foundational introduction to computer vision, deep learning, and remote sensing applications.
